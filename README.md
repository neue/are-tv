arena-angular-starter
=====================

This is a fork of broskoski's cool [Angular Arena Starter](https://github.com/broskoski/arena-angular-starter). Mostly it trims out all the CSS and layout markup, It also fills in the title and meta-description with whatever's in your Arena Channel.

**Installation:**

Copy this html file to anywhere on a webserver, and have at it!

**Note:**

If you are developing locally, I use python's SimpleHTTPServer. Navigate to your folder in the terminal and paste:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
    
Then, visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
